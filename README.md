# Machine Learning: Predicting Customer Churn using Decision Tree Classifier
This Dataset contains the step-by-step process of building a Decision Tree Classifier model to predict Customer Churn based on provided information form the dataset. The dataset used in this project was collected from the [Datacamp course](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/marketing-analytics-predicting-customer-churn-in-python)

What is customer churn?
<br>It is when an existing customer, user, player, subscriber or any kind of return client stops doing business or ends the relationship with a company.

The goal of this project is to Design a Decision Tree Classifier and tune it to predict if a customer will churn or not.
